## Introduction

A subtle but significant difference between the Win32 API and the Native
API (see [Inside the Native
API](../inside-native-applications.md) for
more information on this largely undocumented interface) is the way that
names are described. In the Win32 API strings are interpreted as
NULL-terminated ANSI (8-bit) or wide character (16-bit) strings. In the
Native API names are counted Unicode (16-bit) strings. While this
distinction is usually not important, it leaves open an interesting
situation: there is a class of names that can be referenced using the
Native API, but that cannot be described using the Win32 API.

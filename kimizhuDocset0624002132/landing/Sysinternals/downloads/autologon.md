## Introduction

Autologon enables you to easily configure Windows’ built-in autologon
mechanism. Instead of waiting for a user to enter their name and
password, Windows uses the credentials you enter with Autologon, which
are encrypted in the Registry, to log on the specified user
automatically.

*Autologon* is easy enough to use. Just run autologon.exe, fill in the
dialog, and hit Enable. To turn off auto-logon, hit *Disable*. Also, if
the shift key is held down before the system performs an autologon, the
autologon will be disabled for that logon. You can also pass the
username, domain and password as command-line arguments:

**autologon user domain password**

**Note:** When Exchange Activesync password restrictions are in place,
Windows will not process the autologon configuration.

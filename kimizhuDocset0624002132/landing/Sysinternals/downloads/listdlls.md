## Introduction

ListDLLs is a utility that reports the DLLs loaded into processes. You
can use it to list all DLLs loaded into all processes, into a specific
process, or to list the processes that have a particular DLL loaded.
ListDLLs can also display full version information for DLLs, including
their digital signature, and can be used to scan processes for unsigned
DLLs.

## Usage

**listdlls \[-r\] \[-v | -u\] \[processname|pid\]  
listdlls \[-r\] \[-v\] \[-d dllname\]**

 
----------------- 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **processname**   Dump DLLs loaded by process (partial name accepted).
  **pid**           Dump DLLs associated with the specified process id.
  **dllname**       Show only processes that have loaded the specified DLL.
  **-r**            Flag DLLs that relocated because they are not loaded at their base address.
  **-u**            Only list unsigned DLLs.
  **-v**            Show DLL version information.

information:

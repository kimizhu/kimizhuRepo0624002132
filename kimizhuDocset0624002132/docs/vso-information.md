# VSO information

> [!NOTE]
> **03-17-2017** -- This information is subject to change due to writing team changes. There is a proposal to route all Docs content updates through TechnicalContent.
> **03-15-2017** -- We have approval for getting APEXProd and APEXProdLeads as assignees in VSO. Once this goes through, we'll use those instead of JasGro's credentials to assign.

# Communications best practices
This page captures best practices for handling bugs for docs.microsoft.com. As we develop our style of working, we'll add to this page as appropriate.

## Hub pages
Here are best practices for working on Hub pages.

### Art changes
When a new hub page is created, it generally requires new graphics for the cards. The design team (with designers Kim Tapia St. Amant and Chris Johnson with illustrator Valerie Rosen) creates all hub page graphics. 
1. When a new page is requested, make sure Kim is @mentioned in the bug and alerted to the need for graphics. 
2. During page development, any time changes are made that require new cards on the page (per stakeholder feedback, for instance), @mention Kim and Valerie Rosen to alert them to the new graphics required.
